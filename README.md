### App Description
Description: An app where students can trade notes for different courses.

### App Idea Evaluation
- Mobile: It will be created in a way where submitting picture from your phone will be really easy. You can also use your location to show           what school you go to and specify the classes you take.
- Story: Every student knows the difficulty of getting back on track after you have had to miss a lecture. This app will help negate that by sharing their notes.
- Market: This is speciffically for high school and college students.
- Habit: Any student can use this app, either if they went class are are going to upload their notes, or if they missed class and need a recap of the lesson that day. 
- Scope: I think building this app won't be too hard. The harder part will be finding a location to upload and store all the pictures and files students submit.
